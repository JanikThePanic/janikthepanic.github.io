Eight of the switches are programmed to simulate keystrokes and act as macros for any use. The top two switches change the board’s current “Mode” and macro “Page”, allowing the board to simulate more than eight macros. The current “Mode” is displayed by the first RGB LED, showing a custom colour for the mode, well the second LED displays the “Page”.",

				"heading": "Conclusion",
				"text": "Although it was fun designing it, the MacroBox has many major flaws. To begin, the Cherry MX Blues are backwards and are meant to have the LEDs facing forward. I only noticed that as I was working on the MacroBox v2. Secondly, the RGB LEDs are missing resistors, and so the code would have to account for that. Thirdly, I believe the backlighting LEDs are wired incorrectly on the PCB, which may lead to inconsistent lighting. Maybe. I am not certain of that."

			{
				"text": "Overall, the MacroBox v1 was just a learning experience for me. I hope to have MacroBox v2 be a cheap and dirty version of the MacroBox v1, just so I can afford to make it. In the end, I plan on having a MacroBox Pro, which will have all the electrical figured out, will be tilted on an angle, will look spectacular, and will have a custom device driver that can program the board."
