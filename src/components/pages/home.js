				Starting as a hobbyist, I aim to turn my passion for anything
				robotics-related into a career. Over the years, I have picked up
				a wide variety of skills but most importantly adapted to be a
				quick and efficient learner with the drive to see things done.

				I could say many things here about my skills and inspirations,

			<p>i like robots. (INCLUDING the 2005 film, Robots)</p>
